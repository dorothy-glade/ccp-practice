# Certified Cloud Practitioner Tracker with Terraform

Hello! My name is Dorothy. I'm a Cloud/DevOps Engineer looking to improve my technical skills. This repository serves a dual purpose for me:


1. **Study Tracker for AWS**: I'm currently going over the content in the Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. Every time I come across a hands-on section, I'll be tracking my progress here. 
2. **Hands-on with Terraform**: As a DevOps Engineer, I recognize the importance of Infrastructure as Code. I'm using Terraform to track all of the resources that I create in the hands-on labs. 

## Why This Approach? ##

After much experimentation, I've come to the conclusion that getting my hands on a keyboard is the only way to really grasp all of these concepts. 

1. **Practical Learning**: While the Certified Cloud Practitioner exam provides foundational cloud knowledge, Terraform allows me to implement what I learn practically.
2. **Skill Synergy**: Cloud and IaC go hand-in-hand in the modern DevOps landscape. Grasping these in tandem ensures I have a holistic understanding of deploying and managing infrastructure.
3. **Future-Ready**: As more businesses migrate to the cloud, expertise in both cloud principles and IaC tools like Terraform will be in high demand.

Thank you for taking the time to look over this repo. Please feel free to make suggestions as you see fit.
